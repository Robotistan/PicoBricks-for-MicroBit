## Mini Tank
Tanks, with their tracked structures, are vehicles that can easily move on rough terrains.
Tracks consist of multiple sequential wheels or rollers surrounded by a belt.
The PicoBricks Mars Explorer Car is a wooden project kit that utilizes two DC motors and
a tracked platform. This robot car, controllable remotely with a remote controller thanks to
the IR receiver, can decide on its movements by detecting surrounding objects through
the front of its distance sensor.
