## Micro:bit Safe Box
The PicoBricks Safe Box is an educational project kit designed to create a safe box that
automatically locks after assembling the wooden pieces and PicoBricks modulesaccording
to the installation steps.
In this project, when the correct password is entered by using a potentiometer and button,
the door of the safe opens. After closing the door, it automatically locks thanks to the LDR
sensor inside the safe.
